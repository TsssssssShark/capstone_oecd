(Annie Fouquet, SFE).  C’est sur la base de cette définition de la Société française d’évaluation (SFE) que les évaluations de politique publique dans le cadre de la MAP (Modernisation de l’action publique, 2012-2017) ont été conduites (memo sur l’évaluation des politiques publiques de la MAP, 2015) : “Les questions évaluatives visent à interroger l’ensemble de la chaîne de valeur d’une action publique à partir des critères évaluatifs standards (efficacité, efficience, cohérence, utilité, pertinence) et des orientations structurantes de la modernisation (simplification, innovation, numérique, ouverture des données, soutenabilité...) ».  Décret du 18 novembre 1998 (no 98-1048) : « L’évaluation d’une politique publique, au sens du présent décret, a pour objet d’apprécier, dans un cadre interministériel, l’efficacité de cette politique en comparant ses résultats aux objectifs assignés et aux moyens mis en œuvre ».  Décret du 22 janvier 1990 (no 90-82) : « L’évaluation d’une politique publique au sens du présent décret a pour objet de rechercher si les moyens juridiques, administratifs ou financiers mis en œuvre permettent de produire les effets attendus de cette politique et d’atteindre les objectifs qui lui sont assignés ».\\\\\nIreland & Evaluation - The process of systematically assessing an intervention (ex ante or ex post) to determine efficiency and - effectiveness in achieving a stated objective  Definition contained in the Public Spending Code.
